In today’s world almost every person uses social media and are extremely concerned about
their looks looking at unrealistic body standard created by social media .Bodybuilding is a sport
which is associated with physical strength and also aesthetic perfection. It is a journey which
deeply connects with mental health. The discipline, dedication, and focus which are required
to sculpt one’s body can be extremely empowering, but it can also expose individuals to big
mental health challenges. The constant pressure to achieve an ideal physique especially in
this current world where every one use social media that promotes unachievable appearances,
can for sure lead to conditions like body dysmorphia and eating disorders.

health. It also provide resources, article, mood tracker and also music platforms to
